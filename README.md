# OsuToRobobeat
This is a small converter, currently only converts the **timings** of osu beatmaps.

Still has lots of issues to be fixed.

## Prerequisites 
- Dotnet 7 runtime

## Compiling from source
### Requirements
- Dotnet 7 SDK

### Steps to build
- Open the source folder in terminal
- Type `dotnet build -c Release`
- After these you should be able to run the executable inside`./RoboConverter/bin/release/net7.0/`

## Usage
Input the path to the .osz file (which is the exported/downloaded version of the osu file) and follow the instructions in the terminal.
